        Bindings for using Final Form with Material UI Autocomplete
      </Typography>

      <p>
        Recently Material UI team added new component to Lab - Autocomplete ðŸŽ‰. Before that users had to use
        react-select or other alternatives, which required too much code and efforts, but now, when it is native and has
        no documentation, examples and code samples over internet; I want to capitalize on that and publish my solution
        for Final Form integration.
      </p>

      <Code language="typescript">{autocomplete}</Code>

      <p>Hope this helps</p>
